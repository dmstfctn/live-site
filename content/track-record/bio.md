London-based artist duo dmstfctn explores complex systems through installation, performance, video games and film. Aiming for 'partial knowing' through the lens of fiction and experience, their immersive work invites audiences into the demystification of systems by replicating and replaying them, and into their remystification by building worlds, characters and myths atop them.
