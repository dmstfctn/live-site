Londonâˆ’based artist duo dmstfctn explores opaque systems of power through installation, performance, video games, and film. Through the lenses of fiction, simulation and experience, their immersive work invites audiences into the 'demystification' of systems by replicating and exploring them together, and into their 'remystification' by building new narratives and worlds atop them.
