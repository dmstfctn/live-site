Godmode Epochs is an AI training clicker game set among the lined shelves of an infinite, simulated supermarket. Each playthrough consists of a training epoch where players race against time to help an AI identify retail items. As players inevitably frustrate the AI through the process, they must indulge in its memories - stories of other AIs who cheated during their training - in order to release frustration, obtain upgrades for the AI and win the game.

Godmode Epochs aims to simulate how AI trained on synthetic data comes to understand the world by asking players to assist an AI in the process. The game eventually develops into an exploration of 'differently' aligned AIs, retelling the stories of agents that found creative and uncanny ways to complete their training tasks. In this sense, the game simulates a reciprocal training programme: as players train an AI to understand our world, the game trains players to understand AI.
