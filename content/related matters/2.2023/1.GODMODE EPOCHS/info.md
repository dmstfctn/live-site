Godmode Epochs is an AI training clicker game set in an infinite, simulated supermarket. Players race against time to train an AI to identify products. As players inevitably frustrate the AI, they must indulge in its memories - historical examples of other AIs who cheated during their training - in order to release frustration, obtain upgrades for the AI and complete the training.

Godmode Epochs aims to simulate how AI trained on synthetic data comes to understand the world by asking players to assist an AI in the process. The game eventually develops into an exploration of 'differently' aligned AIs, retelling the (real) stories of machine learning agents that found creative and uncanny ways to complete their training tasks. Godmode Epochs simulates a reciprocal training programme: as players train an AI to understand our world, the game trains players to understand AI.
