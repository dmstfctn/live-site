Godmode Epochs is an AI training clicker game set in an infinite, simulated supermarket. Players race against time to train an AI to identify products. As players inevitably frustrate the AI, they must indulge in its memories - historical examples of other reward hacking and cheating by other AI agents - in order to release frustration, obtain upgrades for the AI and complete the training.

The game simulates how AI trained on synthetic data comes to understand the world by asking players to assist an AI in the process, and it eventually develops into an exploration of unaligned AIs, retelling the stories of agents that found creative, uncanny ways to complete their training tasks. In a reciprocal training programme, players train AI to understand the world and the game trains players to understand AI.
