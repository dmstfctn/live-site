The NETWORK ENSEMBLE is a sound project making use of wireless network data as creative medium. The project consists of machines able to translate data captured from wireless networks into sound and desktop software able to further modulate the sound for live performance.

The performances carried out by the NETWORK ENSEMBLE aim to explore the activity of local wireless networks. <span class="dc-hide-on-small">Notable performances include Design Museum in London, Onassis Stegi in Athens and Spektrum in Berlin.

The NETWORK ENSEMBLE debuted on the Italian label NUKFM in 2017 with SELECTED NETWORK STUDIES. In 2019, the German label MILLE PLATEAUX released FLASH DEMONS.</span>
