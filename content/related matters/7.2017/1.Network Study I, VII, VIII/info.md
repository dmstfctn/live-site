NETWORK STUDY I, Ⅶ & Ⅷ are audiovisual experiments with urban network infrastructure. Each translates wireless network activity captured using custom built hardware and software to sound, text, pictograms&#8196;and&#8196;warping&#8196;satellite&#8196;imagery.

NETWORK STUDY I was captured at the London Internet Exchange, where a thousand network <COLBREAK>operators meet to exchange traffic, and at Canary Wharf,&#8196;a&#8196;global&#8196;financial&#8196;hub&#8196;located&#8196;nearby.

NETWORK STUDY Ⅶ was captured at the Vatican City Department of Telecommunication, which houses Radio Vaticano; a supporter of Marconi's 1930s research into radio transmissions, the Vatican&#8196;was&#8196;an&#8196;early&#8196;adopter&#8196;of&#8196;radio.<COLBREAK>

NETWORK STUDY Ⅷ was captured at the US Embassy in Rome; according to leaked NSA documents false manteinance on the Embassy's roof hid surveillance equipment targeting communications of nearby Italian government administrative&#8196;buildings.
