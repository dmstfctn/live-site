NETWORK STUDY I, Ⅶ & Ⅷ is an audiovisual installation focusing on network infrastructure found in a number of financial, religious and administrative buildings of symbolic importance. NETWORK STUDY I was captured at the London Internet Exchange, where a thousand network operators meet to exchange traffic, and at Canary Wharf, a global financial hub located nearby. NETWORK STUDY Ⅶ was captured at the Vatican City Department of Telecommunication, which houses Radio Vaticano since the 1930s. NETWORK STUDY Ⅷ was captured at the US Embassy in Rome, where leaked NSA documents show equipment hidden on the roof to be surveilling the communications of the Italian government. In each study, wireless network activity captured using custom hardware and software is translated into sound, text, pictograms and warping satellite imagery.
