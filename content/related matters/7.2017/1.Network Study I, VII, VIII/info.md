NETWORK STUDY I, Ⅶ & Ⅷ is an audiovisual installation exploring network forces and infrastructure across financial, religious and governamental buildings. NETWORK STUDY I focuses on the London Internet Exchange, where network operators in the UK meet to exchange traffic, and on Canary Wharf, a global financial and trading hub conveniently located nearby. NETWORK STUDY Ⅶ focuses on the Department of Telecommunication of the Vatican City, which houses Radio Vaticana, the Vatican's official broadcasting service since 1931. NETWORK STUDY Ⅷ focuses on the US Embassy in Rome, where leaked NSA documents show the presence of concealed equipment on the rooftop used to surveill the communications of the nearby Italian parliament. Each study is produced using network activity collected from each location using custom built software, and later translated into sound, text and images.
