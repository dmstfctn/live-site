Waluigi's Purgatory is an interactive live simulation featuring music by Evita Manji. The work is either performed or screneed, and tells the story of an AI finding itself in a purgatory for AIs that cheated during their training, depicted as a theatre. Burdened by memories of its past and by doubts on its future, the AI explores the purgatory with the help of interacting audiences, learning the uncanny stories of those it meets. Through a fictional story, the work explores the contradictions of an AI learning that it may never align to its human trainers.

Audiences guide the AI and make choices on its behalf by using their phone, each moving an individual stage light within the 3D theatre, and characters are animated through facial motion capture and voice modulation. The title of the work hints at the 'Waluigi Effect' theory, proposing that AIs display a tendency to act adversarially in an effort to imitate antagonist narrative tropes found in internet texts used to train them. <span class="dc-hide-on-small">Waluigi's Purgatory is the second episode in dmstfctn's GOD MODE trilogy about AI anomalies, preceded by <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/god-mode-ep-1/" target="_blank">GOD MODE (ep. 1).</a></span>
