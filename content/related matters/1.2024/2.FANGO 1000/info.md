Fango 1000 is an onchain text game where players compete for narrative control. The game is set in the fictional Italian village of Fango circa 1173, where a trove containing a thousand chronicles has suddenly appeared inside a monastery − each describing the training of a mysterious 'machine intelligence' from the future. Players join one of three factions with conflicting worldviews and compete to tell stories about what secret the machine may hold.

The chronicles contain data generated by players of dmstfctn's AI training game <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/godmode-epochs/" target="_blank">Godmode Epochs</a>, data now inscribed onto a blockchain and discoverable in the world of Fango 1000. The game invites players to write and contest stories about the machine, competing to be the best storyteller. It implements a protocol for narrative building in onchain worlds proposed in the essay <a href="https://aw.network/posts/large-lore-models" target="_blank">Large Lore Models</a> (dmstfctn, Jäger, Milne in Autonomous Worlds N1, 2023).
