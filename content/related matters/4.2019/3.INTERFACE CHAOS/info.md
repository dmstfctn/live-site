INTERFACE CHAOS is a short fictional film about the struggle for survival of a palm tree species endemic to the island of Praslin in the archipelago of the Seychelles. Set against a landscape void of human activity and populated by lush nature and the occasional shell of a tax advisor office, the film follows two whispering palm trees in their effort to grow their fruit - the largest seed in the world, known as coco de mer.

INTERFACE CHAOS features an original soundtrack by artist SKY H1. Three excerpts from the film are available on <a href="https://interfacechaos.dmstfctn.net/" target="_blank">interfacechaos.dmstfctn.net</a>.
