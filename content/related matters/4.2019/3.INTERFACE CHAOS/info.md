INTERFACE CHAOS is a short film telling of the struggle for survival of a unique species of palm tree endemic to an island in the archipelago of the Seychelles: the coco de mer. Set against a landscape void of human activity and populated by lush nature and the occasional shell of a tax advisor office, the short film follows two whispering palm trees in their effort to grow their fruit. INTERFACE CHAOS features an original soundtrack by artist SKY H1. Three excerpts from the film can be watched <a href="https://interfacechaos.dmstfctn.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.
