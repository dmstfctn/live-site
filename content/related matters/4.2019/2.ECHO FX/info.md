230616 2200: as polls close on Brexit referendum night, Nigel Farage, a former commodities broker and the face of the Leave campaign, concedes defeat.

230616 2252: in a Foreign Exchange market driven by Remain sentiment, the network effect of Farage's concession pushes the Pound to a 6 month high.

240616 0528: the Pound reaches its lowest point in 30 years, losing 12% of its value against the Dollar.

ECHO FX is an audiovisual performance replaying the echoes of misleading information spread on social media and financial markets on the night of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Triggered by a perfectly timed concession by Nigel Farage, those echoes contributed to inflate the value of the Pound market by spreading rumors of a Brexit loss. As the referendum outcome became apparent later that night and the Pound market crashed, a few London City traders, later demonstrated to have gained access to otherwise private polls pointing to a Leave win, made millions from their timely bets against the Pound.
