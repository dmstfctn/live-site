ECHO FX replays the flow of information on social media and foreign exchange markets on the night of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Following a timely concession by Nigel Farage, rumors of a Leave loss spread, inflating the value of the Pound market. As the referendum outcome became apparent later that night, a number of traders with private polling information pointing to a Leave win made millions from the crashing Pound.

ECHO FX is inspired by a 2018 Bloomberg investigation. It was screened on the third anniversary of referendum night in June 2019 as part of Hyperdub's <a href="https://xn--zer-2na.info/club" target="_blank">Ã˜ club night</a> at Corsica Studios in London, and performed the night before the United Kingdom left the European Union in January 2020 as part of CTM x transmediale festival at Berghain in Berlin. The work is included in the homonymous book <a href="http://www.krisispublishing.com/prodotto/echo-fx/" target="_blank">ECHO FX</a> (Krisis Publishing, 2021), collecting essays and visual contributions by writers and artists responding to the events narrated in the piece.
