INTERFACE CHAOS is the debut short film of DMSTFCTN, exploring the search for survival of two entities coexisting in the archipelago of the Seychelles: money and a unique species of palm tree. In INTERFACE CHAOS, money and palm trees are each observed facing uncertainties in a landscape void of human activity and filled with the empty shells of tax advisors' offices. Against this backdrop, the short film follows two whispering palm trees in their effort to grow their fruit. INTERFACE CHAOS features an original soundtrack by artist SKY H1 and can be watched on <a href="http://interfacechaos.com/" target="_blank">INTERFACECHAOS.COM</a>.
