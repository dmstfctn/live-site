INTERFACE CHAOS is a short fictional film about two whispering palm trees. Set on the island of Praslin, Seychelles, the film follows the palm trees as they try to grow a coco de mer, their fruit and the world's largest seed, surrounded by empty tax advisor offices and a landscape void of human activity. Three excerpts from the film are available on <a href="https://interfacechaos.dmstfctn.net/" target="_blank">interfacechaos.dmstfctn.net.</a>
