<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">ECHO FX replays the night of the 2016 Brexit referendum through the echoes of misleading information spread on social media.</span> Triggered by a perfectly timed concession, those echoes contributed to inflate the value of the Pound market before the refendum outcome became apparent. As the Pound crashed, a few London City traders with access to private polls pointing to a Leave win made millions&#8196;from&#8196;shorting&#8196;it.
