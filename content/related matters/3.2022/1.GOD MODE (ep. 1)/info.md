GOD MODE (ep. 1) is an interactive performance and installation exploring anomalies in the use of synthetic data for AI training. The work consists in a replica of a live simulation used by Amazon to train its computer vision systems for their cashierless stores, and features an agent endlessly training in it while delivering a fictional monologue on the impossibility of its task - until it finds a bug to complete its training, learning nothing about the world but discovering something about itself.

The agent is animated through facial motion capture and voice modulation, and audiences help it train and escape by modifying the environment through their phone - a technique that is normally automated in synthetic data simulations. GOD MODE (ep. 1) is the first episode in dmstfctn's GOD MODE trilogy about AI anomalies, followed by <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/waluigi-s-purgatory/" target="_blank">Waluigi's Purgatory.</a>
