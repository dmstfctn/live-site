GOD MODE (ep. 1) explores anomalies in the training of AI with synthetic datasets. The work is performed or screened, and consists in a live interactive simulation identical to ones used by Amazon to train computer vision systems for their cashierless stores. An AI agent is endlessly training in the simulation while delivering a fictional monologue on the impossibility of its task - until it finds a bug to complete its training, learning nothing about the world but discovering something about itself.

The agent is animated through facial motion capture and voice modulation, and audiences help it train and escape by modifying the environment through their phone - a technique that is normally automated in synthetic data simulations. GOD MODE (ep. 1) is the first episode in dmstfctn's GOD MODE trilogy about AI anomalies, followed by <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/waluigi-s-purgatory/" target="_blank">Waluigi's Purgatory.</a>

The work is supported by The Alan Turing Institute and Serpentine Arts Technologies.
