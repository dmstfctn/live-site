The Models is an interactive installation exploring the improvisational nature of generative AI, and its sometimes unexpected and nonsensical character. A live simulation running continuously for a year renders theatrical scenes improvised in a style and by a cast inspired by Italian Commedia dell'Arte. Dialogues are generated by a system of AI models prompted to impersonate traditionally servile, lying or antagonistic Commedia masks, such as Arlecchino, and improvising around a set of controversial props that symbolise superstition, folklore, and falsehoods.

26,880 scenes can be rendered with bespoke lighting and music, and in response to the audience's casting and scenographic preferences as prompted through their phone. Influenced by the prompted scene and by Commedia archetypes present in their training dataset, the modelsâ€™ output is unpredictable and reliably rich of confabulation, mistakes, and surprise.

The text and voice generation system was assembled by the artists using the Leonardo Supercomputer <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/eudigitaldeal/en/residencies/the-models-by-dmstfctn/" target="_blank">during a residency</a>.
