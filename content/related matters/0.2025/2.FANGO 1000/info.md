Fango 1000 is a fully onchain text-based role playing game where players compete for narrative control. The game is set in the fictional Italian village of Fango circa 1173, where a trove containing a thousand chronicles has suddenly appeared inside a monastery - each describing how humans from another time train a mysterious 'machine intelligence' for an unknown task. Players join one of three factions with conflicting worldviews and compete to tell stories about what the machine may be, what secret it may hold, and what role it may play in society.

The game is developed with MUD, an open-source framework for blockchain games. Incidentally, players can throw mud ('fango' in Italian) at the stories they dislike.

The chronicles in Fango 1000 contain a historical record of actions generated by players of the AI training game <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/godmode-epochs/" target="_blank">Godmode Epochs</a> (2024) and deployed to a blockchain. In this sense, the game aims to be a prototype of a Large Lore Model (LloreM), a tool to connect players actions with theirs and other players' stories and perspectives. A Large Lore Model was first hypothesised in the 2023 essay of the same name, co-written with Alasdair Milne and Eva JÃ¤ger, and published in 'Autonomous Worlds N1' by <a href="https://autonomousworlds.metalabel.com/aw01?variantId=1" target="_blank">Metalabel</a>.
