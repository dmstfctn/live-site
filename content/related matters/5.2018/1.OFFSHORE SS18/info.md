OFFSHORE SS18 is a limited edition beachwear collection sold through an <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/offshore-investigation-vehicle/" target="_blank">offshore corporate structure</a> set up by dmstfctn. Each purchase through a <a href="http://shop.dmstfctn.net/" target="_blank">dedicated online shop</a> activated a functional tax avoidance scheme, moving revenue through the structure to avoid tax. The scheme's details are printed on the apparel as diagrams and patterns. The resulting savings were distributed to members of the public who had invested in the structure during a <a href="https://youtu.be/4ef4IypFNns" target="_blank">public performance</a> at transmediale festival in Berlin.<br>
