description: A beachwear collection and tax avoidance scheme
---

OFFSHORE SS18 is a tax avoidance scheme and collection of beachwear consisting of swimsuits, swim shorts and beach towels. The apparel was produced in a limited edition of 90 items and sold through an international corporate structure, or <a href="https://dmstfctn.net/related-matters/offshore-investigation-vehicle/" target="_blank">Offshore Investigation Vehicle</a>, set up by the artists across a&#8192;number&#8192;of&#8192;tax&#8192;havens.

Any customer purchasing beachwear from a <a href="http://shop.dmstfctn.net/" target="_blank">dedicated online shop</a> triggered a tax avoidance scheme whereby the revenue from the sale would be moved to a tax haven in order to avoid corporate tax. The resulting savings were distributed to members of the public who had invested in the corporate structure during a <a href="https://youtu.be/4ef4IypFNns" target="_blank">public performance</a> held at transmediale festival 2018 in Berlin. The performance was one in a series exploring the structure and operational scope of&#8192;the&#8192;Offshore&#8192;Investigation&#8192;Vehicle.

Details of the tax avoidance scheme are documented on the apparel through diagrams and patterns. Sales ended in June 2018, when the companies making up the corporate structure<a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10807527/filing-history/QTcxWDBDT1phZGlxemtjeA/document?format=pdf&download=0" target="_blank">were dissolved</a> just before their accounts were due to be submitted to tax authorities, mimicking a tactic observed in corporate wrongdoing. OFFSHORESS18 aimed to test a functional model of an offshore corporate structure by circulating a small amount of capital through it and exposing the process.
