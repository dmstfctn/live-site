FLASH is a sonic reenactment of the stock market crash of May 6, 2010, amongst the fastest in history. Performed on the 8<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the crash at the <a href="https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/talks-courses-and-workshops-not-in-use/alt-age-designing-belief" target="_blank">Design Museum</a> in London, the piece searches for a narrative to the market accident, translating historic data from the day's trading at NYSE and Chicago Stock Exchange into sound, and sampling news commentary about seemingly unconnected global events that day, from electoral uncertainty in the UK to demonstrations against austerity policies in Greece. 

Speculations on what caused the crash continued until 2015, when a London trader was arrested on market manipulation charges. The trader pleaded guilty to profiting from the market's volatility by using software hacked to enable spoofing, a tactic to alter the perceived supply and demand of a market commodity in order to affect its price.<br><br>A recording of the performance is included in <a href="https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/flash-demons" target="_blank">Flash Demons</a> (MILLE PLATEAUX, 2019).
