AV performance
22 minutes

Performed: Spektrum (Berlin)<span class="dc-hide-on-large"><br><br></span>

DEMONS is an audiovisual reenactment of the October 19, 1987 stock market crash known as Black Monday, the first in which algorithmic trading was implicated. Performed on the the 31<sup>st</sup> anniversary of the crash at <a href="https://radicalnetworks.org/archives/2018/participants/network-ensemble/" target="_blank">Spektrum</a> in Berlin, the piece explores confirmation bias in algorithmic trading, translating historic data from the day's trading at the New York Stock Exchange into sound.

Responding to a set of seemingly unconnected events unfolding at the time of market opening, the computers of institutional investors on the New York Stock Exchange executed a number of automated trades in order to protect the values of their portfolios against volatile market conditions. As the computers followed each others' trading patterns, a panic selling domino effect was triggered. A recording of the performance is included in <a href="https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/flash-demons" target="_blank">Flash Demons</a> (MILLE PLATEAUX, 2019).
