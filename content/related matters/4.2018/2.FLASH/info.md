FLASH is a sonic reenactment of one of the fastest stock market crashes in history, occurring on May 6, 2010 and known as Flash Crash. As a set of strange events took place globally on that day, from an uncertain election outcome in the UK to demonstrations against austerity policies in Greece, US commentators searched for a meaningful narrative to the unfolding market accident.

Speculations on what happened continued until 2015, when a London trader was arrested and extradited to the US to be investigated on market manipulation charges. The trader admitted to profiting from the market during high volatility by using software hacked to enable spoofing, a tactic to alter the perceived supply and demand of a market commodity in order to affect its price.

<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape">FLASH was performed on the 8<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the crash, translating May 6, 2010 trading data from the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange into sound. The performance was released in 2019 by German label <a href="https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/flash-demons" target="_blank">MILLE PLATEAUX</a>.</span>
