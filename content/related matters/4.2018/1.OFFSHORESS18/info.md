description: A beachwear collection and tax evasion scheme
---

OFFSHORESS18 is a beachwear collection consisting of three swimsuits, two pairs of swim shorts and a beach towel. The apparel was<span class="dc-hide-on-small-landscape"> produced in an edition of 90 total items and</span> sold through an international corporate structure set up by DMSTFCTN in order to model&#8196;a&#8196;simple&#8196;tax&#8196;avoidance&#8196;scheme.
<COLBREAK>
Any customer purchasing beachwear from <a href="http://shop.dmstfctn.net/" target="_blank">shop.dmstfctn.net</a> triggered a tax evasion scheme whereby the revenue from the sale would be moved to a tax haven in order to evade corporate tax. The resulting savings were distributed back to members of the public who had originally invested in the collection&#8196;by&#8196;purchasing&#8196;shares&#8196;in&#8196;the&#8196;company&#8196;producing&#8196;it.

The work aims to test a functional model of an offshore corporate structure by circulating a small amount of money through it and, in doing so, to further let investors witness the process from an advantageous point of view. The tax evasion scheme is documented through diagrams printed on the apparel.
